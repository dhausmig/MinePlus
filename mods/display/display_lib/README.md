# Display Lib

This library's purpose is to ease creation of nodes with one or more displays on sides. For example, signs and clocks. Display can be dynamic and/or different for each node instance.

**Limitations**: This lib uses entities to draw display. This means display has to be vertical. So display nodes rotation are limitated to "upside up" positions.

**Dependancies**:default

**License**: LPGL

**API**: See [API.md](https://github.com/pyrollo/display_modpack/blob/master/display_lib/API.md) document please.
