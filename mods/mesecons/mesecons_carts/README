Mesecons Integration for Carts
==============================

This mod adds several types of rails for use with the existing carts from minetest_game:

* Mesecons-Controlled Powered Rail
-- When powered via mesecons, accelerates carts with the same power as a normal powered rail.
-- When not powered, acts as a normal rail.

* Mesecons-Controlled Brake Rail
-- When powered via mesecons, decelerates carts with the same power as a normal brake rail.
-- When not powered, acts as a normal rail.

* Mesecons-Controlled Strong Powered Rail
-- When powered via mesecons, accelerates carts with twice the power of a normal powered rail.
-- When not powered, acts as a normal rail.

* Mesecons-Controlled Strong Brake Rail
-- When powered via mesecons, decelerates carts with twice the power of a normal brake rail.
-- When not powered, acts as a normal rail.

* Mesecons Detector Rail
-- Allows carts to pass over like a normal rail.
-- Emits a brief mesecons pulse whenever a cart passes over it.

* Mesecons-Controlled Start-Stop Rail
-- When not powered, causes any carts passing over it to come to an immediate stop.
-- When powered via mesecons while the cart is still stopped on it, causes the cart to resume moving with its previous speed.
-- If left powered, acts as a normal rail.

* Mesecons Conducting Rail
-- Acts as a normal rail (does not specially affect the cart) but conducts mesecons signals.

* Digilines Controlled Rail (available only if digilines is installed)
-- Sends a table on its set channel when passed over by a cart, including the following elements:
---- pos: Exact position of the cart
---- velocity: X and Z velocity of the cart
---- driver: Name of the player inside the cart (nil if none)
-- Responds to the following commands on its set channel:
---- "grab": Stops a cart traveling over the rail, same as the start-stop rail. Only does anything if a cart is present when the command is issued.
---- "release": Restarts a cart stopped via the "grab" command, causing it to resume moving with its previous speed.
---- "power1" through "power15": Causes the rail to act as a powered rail. The power of a normal powered rail is 5.
---- "brake1" through "brake15": Causes the rail to act as a brake rail. The power of a normal brake rail is 5.
---- "idle" (also "power0" or "brake0"): Causes the rail to act as a normal rail, applying no power or braking force.

* Digilines Conducting Rail (available only if digilines is installed)
-- Acts as a normal rail (does not specially affect the cart) but conducts digilines signals.

* Mesecons and Digilines Conducting Rail (available only if digilines is installed)
-- Acts as a normal rail (does not specially affect the cart) but conducts both mesecons and digilines signals.
