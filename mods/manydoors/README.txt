manydoors mod for minetest
by dhausmig
including Extra Doors by sorcerykid

The doors mod that comes with minetest_game defines a wooden door and a steel
door but there are fences for every kind of wood I decided to make doors for
every kind of wood and ingot. Then I decided to make versions with and without
windows. Then I found the extra_doors mod and since it used the same license
(LGPL 3.0) that I was using, I decided to include it here in its entirety.
 I have tried to give full credit to sorcerykid for his part of this mod.
 The text of that license is in the file extra_doors.txt which is a copy of his
 original README.txt file. The line below is his original description.txt file.

Extra Doors adds a set of 18 new doors to Minetest including castle, dungeon, barn, cottage, and multi-panel styles.
